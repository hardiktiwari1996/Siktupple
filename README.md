# solution of 2 question
1.In this we will first of all take the total number of the elements .
2.We will declare the first array whose length is equal to the total number of the elements.
3.Then we will take the input of all the elements using the for loop and then storing it in the array.
4.Then we will create second array of the same length as that of the size of the first array.
5.Then we will copy the elements of the first array to the second array using the for loop.
6.Then we will declare the another loop and in that we will call the function.
7.in the function we will declare the nested loop and we will check the sum is equal to the any of the elements and then return the total no of the elements and the print it .
